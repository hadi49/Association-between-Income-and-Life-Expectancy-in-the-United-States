# Association-between-Income-and-Life-Expectancy-in-the-United-States
The relationship between income and life expectancy is well established but remains poorly understood. This project will study data gathered in the context of a study the results of which were published in The Association Between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014., Chetty R, Stepner M, Abraham S, et al., JAMA. 2016; 315(16):1750-1766.

That study used income data for the US population obtained from 1.4 billion deidentiÔ¨Åed tax records between 1999 and 2014 and mortality data obtained from Social Security Administration death records. You will use the data to estimate the distribution of income groups by gender and how life expectancy varies by income group.
